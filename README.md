# Hangman Game
A program where it would randomly choose a word from word.py. The words from word.py comes in various length.
Your job as the player is to guess this word and you have 6 lives (where you lose if you guessed 6 times incorrectly)

## Example of Hangman
For example if the word was "dog" the game would display it like this:
```
- - -
```

If you guessed a letter correctly i.e. d in this scenario then it would replace a - with a letter 'd':
```
d - -
```
But guessed incorrectly then you lose a live.
