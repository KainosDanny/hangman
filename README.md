A program where it would randomly choose a word from word.py. The words from word.py comes in various length.
Your job as the player is to guess this word and you have 6 lives (where you lose if you guessed 6 times incorrectly)

## Example of Hangman
For example if the word were "dog" the game would display the word as - - - and if you guessed a letter correctly i.e. d then it would replace - with d as seen here d - - but guessed incorrectly then you lose a live.
